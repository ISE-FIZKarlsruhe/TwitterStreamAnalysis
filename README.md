# Apollo:  Twitter Stream Analyzer of Trending Hashtags: A case-study of #COVID-19

This tool focuses on introducing a new tool named Apollo which analyzes the textual information in the twitter streams using sliding time window. It visualizes knowledge based sentiment analysis as well as emotion detection of the masses about a trending world wide topic such as #COVID-19, #ClimateChange, #BlackLivesMatter, etc.

The folder mood_mappings contain the mappings of <a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/">WordNet</a> to their sentiment scores, i.e., positive, negative, neutral from <a href="https://github.com/aesuli/SentiWordNet">SentiWordNet</a>. It also contains the mappings between different emotions as depicted in <a href="https://github.com/marcoguerini/DepecheMood/releases/">DepecheMood</a> and WordNet which were originally introduced in Framester.

Apollo has been launched at: <a href="http://covid-twitter-stream.fiz-karlsruhe.de/">Apollo</a>.
